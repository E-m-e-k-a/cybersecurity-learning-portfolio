# Cybersecurity Learning Portfolio

Hello! I'm Jesse from  Nigeria — an aspiring **SOC Analyst** (entry point) with the long-term goal of becoming a **Red Teamer**.

This repo tracks my hands-on cybersecurity journey, starting with **TryHackMe's Pre Security** learning path. I'm building strong foundations in networking, how the web works, Linux, and Windows — essential for blue team triage and later offensive techniques.

**Current Progress:** ## Progress
- ✅ Phase 1: Network Setup 
- ✅ Phase 2: Network Discovery 
- 🔄 Phase 3: Vulnerability Testing 
**Total Goal:** Complete Pre Security → SOC Level 1 → Offensive paths

## Why Pre Security?
These basics help me understand:
- How networks and packets work (critical for spotting anomalies in SOC alerts)
- Web technologies (DNS, HTTP — foundation for web exploits)
- Linux & Windows operations (most real-world systems)

## Path Progress
I'll update this with notes, key takeaways, screenshots, and commands as I go.

### Completed
- **Introduction to Cyber Security**  
  - Offensive vs Defensive security  
  - Cyber career paths

- **Network Fundamentals**  
  - OSI Model, LAN, Packets & Frames, Extending Networks
  - 
## Documentation
- [Network Setup](network-setup.md) - Lab configuration
- [Network Discovery](network-discovery.md) - Port scanning and service identification


### Upcoming
- HTTP in Detail
- How Websites Work
- Putting it all together
- Linux Fundamentals (Parts 1–3)
- Windows Fundamentals (1–3)

## How I'll Document
- Screenshots of TryHackMe completion badges/tasks
- Personal notes & explanations
- Key commands / diagrams
