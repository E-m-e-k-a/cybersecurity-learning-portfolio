# Cybersecurity Learning Portfolio

Hello! I'm Jesse from  Nigeria — an aspiring **SOC Analyst** (entry point) with the long-term goal of becoming a **Red Teamer**.

This repo tracks my hands-on cybersecurity journey, starting with **TryHackMe's Pre Security** learning path. I'm building strong foundations in networking, how the web works, Linux, and Windows — essential for blue team triage and later offensive techniques.

**Current Progress:** In the "How The Web Works" module (just finished DNS in Detail, resting before HTTP in Detail)  
**Total Goal:** Complete Pre Security → SOC Level 1 → Offensive paths

## Why Pre Security?
These basics help me understand:
- How networks and packets work (critical for spotting anomalies in SOC alerts)
- Web technologies (DNS, HTTP — foundation for web exploits)
- Linux & Windows operations (most real-world systems)

## Path Progress
I'll update this with notes, key takeaways, screenshots, and commands as I go.

### Completed
- **Introduction to Cyber Security**  
  - Offensive vs Defensive security  
  - Cyber career paths

- **Network Fundamentals**  
  - OSI Model, LAN, Packets & Frames, Extending Networks

### In Progress
- **How The Web Works**  
  - DNS in Detail ✅ (learned recursive resolution, record types like A/AAAA/CNAME/MX, TTL, root/TLD/authoritative servers)

### Upcoming
- HTTP in Detail
- How Websites Work
- Putting it all together
- Linux Fundamentals (Parts 1–3)
- Windows Fundamentals (1–3)

## How I'll Document
- Screenshots of TryHackMe completion badges/tasks
- Personal notes & explanations
- Key commands / diagrams
